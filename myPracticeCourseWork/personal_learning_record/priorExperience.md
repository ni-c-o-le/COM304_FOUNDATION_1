In 2020 during covid, I started to take an interest in gaming and started to research creating my own plug-ins and mods for minecraft. I then started to do some free online courses in computing.

I attended college for 2 years where I studied IT: Digital, Production, Design and development. This course focused on Using IT in a business and python programming. I learned about Networks, The Cloud, Computer components, Terminoligy, Boolean Logic, Binary and Basic Coding like python, HTML, CSS, JAVA and SQL.

I had a college placement with an IOT comapny called 'Velocity RDT' where we worked on a project of Automation and building new houses for the less fortunate and placing QR codes on smart appliances as guidence for them.

I took a 2 and a half year break from studying and worked in a financial institution as a savings adviser where i spent a lot of time with the IT support desk and core systems support learning how they each contribute to the business. I spent some time with the data department where they showed me how the societys informaion is stored within SQL.


I havent been in education for a long time so feel i need to recap my knowledge and relearn certian areas in depth as i have forgotten a lot of topics covered before jumping into a big degree.
